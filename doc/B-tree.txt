B-Tree B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access,
insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. The B-tree generalizes the binary search tree, allowing for nodes with more 
than two children.[2] Unlike other self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree is well suited for storage systems that
read and write relatively large blocks of data, such as databases and file systems.

Time Complexity
	  Average      Worst Case
Space      O(n)         O(n)
Search     O(logn)	O(logn)
Insert	   O(logn)	O(logn)
Delete	   O(logn)	O(logn)
