# Chaining

Write the implementation of chain, and write a quick comparison using strings demonstrating how much faster the tree-based approach is at large sizes, n=100kB, 1MB, 10MB, and 100MB. YOu should be able to load in a file, manipulate it (insert characters, insert lines of text, remove lines of text, etc.) and save it out to disk. Implement a quick string-based version as a basis of comparison.
