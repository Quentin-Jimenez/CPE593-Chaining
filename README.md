# Chaining

Write the implementation of chain, and write a quick comparison using strings demonstrating how much faster the tree-based approach is at large sizes, n=100kB, 1MB, 10MB, and 100MB. YOu should be able to load in a file, manipulate it (insert characters, insert lines of text, remove lines of text, etc.) and save it out to disk. Implement a quick string-based version as a basis of comparison.

Chaining implementation utilizes a b-tree structure as well as a memorypool for faster access.

## Code Directory


### Source Code
Located in m-way-trees/src
The file built is named chain_main.cpp
[m-way-trees/src]( https://github.com/Quentin-Jimenez/CPE593-Chaining/tree/main/m-wayTrees/src )

Also located in this directory is other files used for development and a testfile to be read in and inserted into the chain structure.

### Old work
This includes all the work done for our previous implementation of Chain. This work was incorrect and down the wrong path, but left it to show former efforts.
